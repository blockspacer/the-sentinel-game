TO DO
-----

* Hyperspace

* Player tree creation

* Sentinel tree creation

* Sentries:

	- superclass of Sentinel?
	- model
	
* Meanies:

	- code
	- model

* Better tree model.

* Better flat square texture

* Better box textures, maybe multi-resolution/colors

* Boulder raycasting:

	- put AABBs in Kd tree
	
* code entry menus, with rotating landscape displayed.

* billboards (cylindrical) for sentinel absorbing beam

* Icons for HUD (synthoid shells, trees, boulders). Sentinel absorbing indicator

* Cool title screen(s), taking after the original one.

* Better indication of selected square (currently just a placeholder really).

+ Timing statistics                                       +
+---------------------------------------------------------+

Modify FPS calculator to print the period of other quantities, with macro calls 
like TIMER(rendering), TIMER(raycasting), and probably matching timer end calls 
TIMER_END(rendering).

These could be smart enough to know if a given timer is contained in another, 
e.g. the number of ms reported by TIMER(terrain_rendering) is some fraction of 
the number reported for rendering in total TIMER(rendering). The reported times 
could be displayed nested.

Probably overlapping timers should be disallowed to avoid confusion, i.e. if TIMER(B) is 
called after TIMER(A) but before TIMER_END(A), TIMER_END(B) must come before TIMER_END(A).

TIMER(A)  ...  TIMER(B) ..... TIMER_END(B) .... TIMER_END(A)

Not:

TIMER(A)  ...  TIMER(B) ..... TIMER_END(A) .... TIMER_END(B)

The latter should generate a warning.

The printout will be something like:

rendering: 10
+- terrain: 4
   mesh: 6
   +- boulder: 3 
      tree: 3
sentinel: 5  
+- raycasting: 5
   +- player: 3
      tree: 2
   
It might be convenient if, as above,  the timer names need only be unique in the 
current branch (i.e. as long as no parent has that name).

+ Particle system                                         +
+---------------------------------------------------------+

Would be nice to play around with this. Maybe a flock of birds flying around?
Timers will be useful here to make sure the cost is small.
